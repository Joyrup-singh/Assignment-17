// What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the

// Importance of Declaring Variables

/*
Just like in algebra, we use variables in programming languages to hold values. JavaScript includes variables that are used to hold the data value and it can also be changed anytime
 */

/*

'let" Keyword:

Just like var in Javascript, let keyword is also used for variable declaration. But the only difference is the variable declared with the “let” keyword is block-scoped and local variable. A variable declared with let will be out of scope outside the block within which it has been declared.
