// Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
// Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

/*
Readability and Understandability: Clear and meaningful variable names make your code more readable and understandable. When someone, including yourself, reads the code later on, descriptive variable names make it easier to comprehend the purpose and intent of the variable.

// example:

const firstNumber = 10;
const secondNumber = 20;
const thirdNumber = 30;
const fourthNumber = 40;
const fifthNumber = 50;
const sixthNumber = 60;

function calculateSum() {
  return firstNumber + secondNumber + thirdNumber + fourthNumber + fifthNumber + sixthNumber;
