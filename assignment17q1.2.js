// Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
// each category.

/*
Arithmetic Operators
These opertors are used for arithmetic operations.
 */

// Addition operators

const x = 4;
const y = 5;
z = x + y;


//Subtraction operators

const a = 4;
const b = 5;
c = a - b;


//Multiplication operators

const d = 4;
const e = 5;
f = d * e;


//Divison operators

const p = 20;
const q = 5;
r = p / q;

// Modulus operators

let k = 5;
let j = 2;
z = k % j;

// Increment operators

let num = 4;
num++;
let Increment = num;

// Decrement operators

let num1 = 5;
num1--;
let Decrement = num1;

// Exponent operators

let n = 5;
let m = n ** 2; 


/* Assignment operators
These opertors are used for assigning values.
 */

// Simple assignment operators

let student = 50;

// Addition assignment operators

let A = 10;
A += 5;

// Subtraction assignment operators

let B = 10;
B -= 5;

// Multiplication assignment operators

let C = 15;
C *= 5;

// Exponentation assignment operators

let P = 10;
P **= 5;

// Division assignment operators

let Q = 10;
Q /= 5;

// Remainder assignment operators

let R = 10;
R %= 5;

// Left Shift Assignment Operator

let w = -100;
w <<= 5;

// Right Shift Assignment Operator

let o = -100;
o >>= 5;

// Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Operator

let O = -100;
O >>>= 5;

// Bitwise AND Assignment Operator

let W = 10;
W &= 5;

//  Bitwise AND Assignment Operator

let box = 10;
box &= 5;

//  Bitwise OR Assignment Operator

let box1 = 10;
box1 |= 5;

//  Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator

let box2 = 10;
box2 ^= 5;

// Logical AND assignment operator 

let box3 = 10;
box3 &&= 5;

//  Logical OR assignment operator

let box4 = 10;
box4 ||= 5;

//  Nullish coalescing assignment operator

let box5;
box5 ??= 5;
